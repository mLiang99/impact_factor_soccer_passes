# Sport Analytics: Modeling the Significance of Soccer Passes 
By Michael Liang and Liam Sharp

A critical element of soccer is the action of passing the ball, yet traditional statistics poorly quantify them despite the frequency of their occurrence. Though conventional metrics can depict an adequate portrait of a team’s passing throughout a match and/or season, measuring the true influence of a team’s ball movement is practically impossible without advanced data collection and analytics. For instance, inferring that Manchester City is the best passing team in the Premier League because they lead the field in average passes per game (688.39) could be a misleading conclusion. [1] The statement may very well be true, but relying on traditional statistics, which by nature omit many crucial aspects of the sport, is a risky proposition when it comes to evaluating performance and developing strategies. Consequently, soccer clubs that are not invested in data analytics run the risk of being left behind by their competitors. 

This paper aims to develop a method of evaluating soccer passes throughout a match. We will review a rudimentary “impact factor” method and propose our own system for evaluating passes. In the conclusion, the applications and benefits of our method, as well as drawbacks and how it could be improved will be discussed in further detail.
